# Machine-Learning-I-Project
This project uses the diabete dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/brandao/diabetes 
The goals is to build different Machine Learning models to predict readmission and treatments for diabetic patients, then compare and choose the best model.
The project has 4 sections:
  1. Data Pre-processing
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Models for Predicting Readmission
  4. Models for Predicting Treatments

Packages to be installed:
  1. !pip install sklearn_pandas
